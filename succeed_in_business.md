These are, in no particular order, notes from the Texas Venture Labs Practicum. They represent my main takeaways and notes from the course. The emphasis is on startups.

## market validation

The idea behind market validation is figuring out whether your idea is actually solving a problem that people would be paying to fix _before_ you invest the money into developing, producing, marketing, and selling the thing. The emphasis is on finding the exact problem that people have and creating an offering (a product or service) that meets that demand. Market validation is the process that allows you to determine whether there's demand for your product. Creating a business model and running pricing estimates will ultimately determine whether you can make money on the product. **See the opportunity, but vet the market.**

Market research should eat up 5% of your budget and take about a month. If you go through the process and realize the market pain isn't there, you've lost a small portion of what you started with.

Of the reasons for failure that you can catch before you go to market, ~85% should be caught by market validation (the remaining 15% by the business model). 

The three steps to market validation are ready (secondary research), aim (primary research), and fire (make the thing).

### ready (secondary research)

This is the step where you do a lot of research using materials that other people have access to--reports, SEX filings, information you pull from databases or websites. You want to get a sense of how big the market is, how its growing, and whether it can support another competitor.

- Domain knowledge. Do something that you already know something about. You won't attract investors if you don't have experience. A successful recipe: the people starting the company have a combination of skills / background, e.g., tech/hard science person, someone with business experience, the entrepreneur. 
- Market sizing: how big is the market and how fast is it growing?  You want to enter markets that are growing faster than the economy. Realize that markets can be segmented. Segment your market and make sure you understand the growth rates for the different segments (beverage industry, sodas, sparkling water, sparkling water in TX).
- Lifecycles and trends. Understand the lifecycle of your product (~6 years for a typical car, ~10 years for a luxury car). Understand where your market is: early adopter, early majority, late majority, laggard. Early majority stage is ideal. For early stages: grow revenue. For late stages: cut expenses. Late majority is where you make your money.
- Understand your competition. Also understand options that don't immediately look like your competition: an iPhone isn't a direct competitor for a laptop, but an iPhone can often substitute for one.

### aim

This step is a lot of direct, primary research. The ready step tells you whether this step is worth your time. If you learn from the aim step that the market growth is too slow or not big enough, cut your losses and move on. 

Otherwise, this step is an attempt to gain as much unbiased, objective knowledge about the market and your potential customers as possible. The goal is to pinpoint the precise market pain and figure out how to fix it.

Ideally, you want to conduct in-person interviews with 100 people. You want to ask them all a similar series of questions. They shouldn't know that you're producing a product. You shouldn't talk to people you already know; you're friends will tell you what you want to hear.

You want to listen to what people tell you. Be objective; you putting on rosy glasses is not going to be helpful when you put the product on the market and no one buys it; no amount of wishing can change the data.

Tips on developing survey questions:

- You need to develop precise questions: the more specific, the better
- Often, open-ended questions can be good, esp. in face-to-face interviews, so that people can talk about the things that make them tick, even if it wasn't something you've already considered.
- You can appeal to people's expertise; people generally like talking about stuff they're good at
- Ask people to rate different features. This will inform what a minimally acceptable feature set of your product will look like.
- If doing an online survey, you want it to take <12 minutes
- If doing an online survey and using a rating scale, always have the scale be odd so that a neutral number is obvious. 7-point scales are a good choice. Use the same scale throughout the survey.
- Flow is important. Think about how you order your questions. Ask an easy question first that most people are going to respond to with a 'yes'. Can also use the first question to disqualify potential survey-takers
- Can ask the same question in two different ways, in different parts of the survey, to disqualify people and see if they're actually putting in a good faith effort.
- 0.25% of Internet users respond to 30% of online surveys
 
## business models

Market validation answers the question: Will people pay for my widget? Business models answer the question: Can I make money selling my widget?

A business model is a top-down financial overview of how your revenue is going to be divvy'ed up. It should be 70-80% correct. 

_Services_ tend to be cheap with low start-up costs and high cash flow. But they aren't scalable and it's easy for others to enter the market.

_Products_ tend to have higher fixed costs (research and development, manufacturing, etc.). But barriers to entry are really high. Variable costs like labor and cost of goods (COGs) tend to be low. They also tend to be highly scaleable.

Some idealized business models for a few industries:

| | Consumer | Manufacturing | Medical | Technology | Services |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Revenue | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Sales & Marketing | 50% | 15% | 35% | 60% | 35% |
| Manufacturing | 25% | 40% | 35% | 15% | 0% |
| COGs | 25% | 40% | 10% | 5% | 35% |
| Profit | 1% | 5% | 20% | 20% | 30% |
| examples / notes | retail and wholesale | profitable but variable | huge failure rate; takes a while to fail (~7-8 years) | hardware, software, telecomm; fail faster; sells for ~8x revenue | think of a consulting company; not scaleable; sells for 1x revenue |

Business models prone to bankruptcy: airlines, hotels, and retail.

## sales and marketing 

- __marketing:__ a tightly integrated effect to discover, create, arose, and satisfy customer needs
- __sales:__ the process of winning a customer with a contract for goods or services. Sales is about listening and aligning customer needs with what the product/service provides.
- **The five P's** You should be able to answer each of these quickly and succinctly for your product
	- product: what is your product or service
	- price: how much are you selling it for
	- packaging
	- place (distribution)
	- promotion
- Products need to be 
	- pervasive :: market big enough to support them
	- urgent :: there's an immediate need for them
	- willing to pay :: customers need to open their pocketbooks
- What is your value proposition? You should have specific answers to these questions:
	- Your product does _what_?
	- For _whom_?
	- Providing the benefits os _what_?
	- And it's better than alternatives _how_?
- Understand the sales funnel. Know the ratio of how many potential customers enter the top of the funnel to the number of people who actually purchase your product. This helps make things _predictable_, and investors/markets like predictability.
- You should be able to define your perfect customer. Aim for this customer. Even if you're off you probably aren't off by that much. Regardless, you should...
- Get to market early and listen to feedback. If you've done market validation, there should be few surprises, but you constantly want your ear to the ground to understand what the market will be willing to pay for. (This is another reason to get a very narrow product out the door with a minimal feature set.)
- Know your customer acquisition costs (CAC) and customer lifetime value (CLV). 


## notes/observations on giving business presentations

- include a timeline
- when defining a plan of what you're going to do, identify: (a) the objective, (b) the deliverable, and (c) the strategy (how you're going to do it)
- have backup ideas
- Diagrams are often not helpful
- keep projects bounded with a well-defined scope
- putting references to where the information came from right on the slide is a good idea, but don't overdo it

## leadership (notes from Mark McClain's talk)

- Some good values to have:
	- innovation - develop solutions to _actual customer challenges_
	- integrity - deliver on your promises
	- impact - measure and reward _results_, not activity
	- individuals - value people (esp. during challenges)
- Whatever your values are, they need to align on all levels of leadership
- Things to look for in people when building a team:
	- hungry :: always striving to be better
	- smart (IQ and EQ)
		- no smart jerks! A jerk can drive people away. Is this person really worth the 5-10 people that might leave because of him/her?
	- humble
		- people that think of themselves less, or think of themselves in the context of a team accomplishing something
	- the first 30-50 people at a company will largely determine its culture going forward.
	- teams should have balanced skills
	- teams should be 8-12 people; team-members should have a strong connection to the leadership
- Tips for managing smart people:
	- don't micromanage
	- show them what success looks like
	- treat people like adults
	- (from my experience): figure out what people are good at and cultivate an environment that let's them be productive
- Debate ideas, not people.

## other notes

- Divorce yourself from your idea. Be as objective as possible. All the research in the Aim phase is meant to do this, but you can be biased researcher--your goal is to get the truth, not want you want to hear.

- Most startups don't have a defined market problem, or want to do to too many things at once. This is a problem. A small company needs to be narrowly focused on producing a product with a minimally acceptable feature set that they can get to market quickly before conditions change. 

- The hard part is typically not the technical challenge; you put enough smart people in a room for long enough and they can come up with a solution. The harder part is figuring out whether will actually pay money for it. 

- Most products or services need to be either _cheaper_ or _better_ to compete; most often, this is done with technology.

- __Under-promise, over-deliver.__

- Money put towards product development _should equal_ that spent on sales and marketing when starting out.

- Companies usually under-estimate the costs of acquiring new customers. Rule of thumb: **The cost of production = the cost of customer acquisition.** Your first 1000 customers are typically pretty cheap to acquire.

- When seeking investors, you want to find the balance between greed and fear. 

- You can't be both a product and a services company (at least not early on). 

- Once companies become established and expand / move into a new market, they typically stop doing market validation. This is a mistake.
